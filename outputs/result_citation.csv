sample_input.xml.xml,JUDICIALCOURTDECISION,F,"Hogan v. State Dep't of Children &amp; Families, 2007 Conn. Super. LEXIS 2125 (Conn. Super. Ct., Aug. 3, 2007)Plaintiff, a former detention facility employee, and defendant, the Department of Children and Families, cross-appealed from a decision of a Connecticut trial court, which remanded plaintiff's case to defendant for a determination of whether plaintiff's name should appear on the central child abuse and neglect registry, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. Â§ 17a-101k. Plaintiff had filed an administrative appeal of defendant's decision.A decision requiring a former detention facility employee to register on the central child abuse and neglect registry, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. Â§ 17a-101k, was upheld on appeal as sufficient evidence supported the finding of abuse and the registry statute satisfied due process and did not constitute a bill of attainder.Defendant had determined that plaintiff was responsible for the abuse of a juvenile and that he posed a risk to the safety and well-being of children such that his name should be placed on defendant's registry. The trial court determined that one factor cited in defendant's decision was not supported by the record and ordered the case remanded. On appeal, plaintiff raised several issues, including constitutional challenges to the registry statute. The court held that the trial court improperly determined that one of the factors relied on by defendant, namely that the case of abuse was not an isolated incident, was not supported by the evidence as the record in fact supported the hearing officer's finding that the episode with the juvenile was not an isolated incident. The court found no merit to plaintiff's constitutional challenges to the registry statute, finding that the parameters of Â§ 17a-101k were sufficiently clear to guide defendant in light of the aim of the legislation and did not constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative power. The court further found that the registry scheme did not violate due process nor did it constitute a bill of attainder.The court reversed the judgment, in part, with respect to the trial court's order remanding the case to defendant. The court remanded the case to the trial court with direction for it to affirm defendant's decision.Raymond J. Rigat, for the appellant-appellee (plaintiff).John E. Tucker, assistant attorney general, with whom, on the brief, were Richard Blumenthal, attorney general, Gregory T. D'Auria, associate attorney general, and Susan T. Pearlman, assistant attorney general, for the appellee-appellant (defendant).KATZ  KATZ, J. The plaintiff, Gregory Hogan, filed an administrative appeal in the trial court from the decision of the defendant, the department of children and families, challenging its findings that the plaintiff was responsible for the abuse of a child and that he posed a risk to the safety and well-being of children such that his name should be placed on the central child abuse and neglect registry (registry) maintained by the defendant pursuant to General Statutes Â§ 17a-101k. General Statutes Â§ 17a-101k provides: ""(a) See Conn. Gen. Stat. Â§ 17a-101k.The Commissioner of Children and Families shall maintain a registry of the commissioner's findings of abuse or neglect of children pursuant to section 17a-101g that conforms to the requirements of this section. The regulations adopted pursuant to subsection (i) of this section shall provide for the use of the registry on a twenty-four-hour daily basis to prevent or discover abuse of children and the establishment of a hearing process for any appeal by a person of the commissioner's determination that such person is responsible for the abuse or neglect of a child pursuant to subsection (b) of section 17a-101g. The information contained in the registry and any other information relative to child abuse, wherever located, shall be confidential, subject to such statutes and regulations governing their use and access as shall conform to the requirements of federal law or regulations. Any violation of this section or the  regulations adopted by the commissioner under this section shall be punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or imprisonment for not more than one year.""(b) Upon the issuance of a recommended finding that an individual is responsible for abuse or neglect of a child pursuant to subsection (b) of section 17a-101g, the commissioner shall provide notice of the finding, by first class mail, not later than five business days after the issuance of such finding, to the individual who is alleged to be responsible for the abuse or neglect. The notice shall:""(1) Contain a short and plain description of the finding that the individual is responsible for the abuse or neglect of a child;""(2) Inform the individual of the existence of the registry and of the commissioner's intention to place the individual's name on the registry unless such individual exercises his or her right to appeal the recommended finding as provided in this section;""(3) Inform the individual of the potential adverse consequences of being listed on the registry, including, but not limited to, the potential effect on the individual obtaining or retaining employment, licensure or engaging in activities involving direct contact with children and inform the individual of the individual's right to administrative procedures as provided in this section to appeal the finding; and""(4) Include a written form for the individual to sign and return, indicating if the individual will invoke the appeal procedures provided in this section.""(c) (1) Following a request for appeal, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall conduct an internal review of the recommended finding to be completed no later than thirty days after the request for appeal is received by the department. The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall review all relevant information relating to the recommended finding, to determine whether the recommended finding is factually or legally deficient and ought to be reversed. Prior to the review, the commissioner shall provide the individual access to all relevant documents in the possession of the commissioner regarding the finding of responsibility for abuse or neglect of a child, as provided in subsection (m) of section 17a-28.""(2) The individual or the individual's representative may submit any documentation that is relevant to a determination of the issue and may, at the discretion of the commissioner or the commissioner's designee, participate in a telephone conference or face-to-face meeting to be conducted for the purpose of gathering additional information that may be relevant to determining whether the recommended finding is factually or legally deficient.""(3) If the commissioner or the commissioner's designee, as a result of the prehearing review, determines that the recommended finding of abuse or neglect is factually or legally deficient, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall so indicate, in writing, and shall reverse the recommended finding. The commissioner shall send notice to the individual by certified mail of the commissioner's decision to reverse or maintain the finding not later than five business days after the decision is made. If the finding is upheld, the notice shall be made in accordance with section 4-177 and shall notify the individual of the right to request a hearing. The individual may request a hearing not later than thirty days after receipt of the notice. The hearing shall be scheduled not later than thirty days after receipt by the commissioner of the request for a hearing, except for good cause shown by either party.""(d) (1) The hearing procedure shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures for contested cases pursuant to sections 4-177 to 4-181a, inclusive.""(2) At the hearing, the individual may be represented by legal counsel. The burden of proof shall be on the commissioner to prove that the finding is supported by a fair preponderance of the evidence submitted at the hearing.""(3) Not later than thirty days after the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a written decision to either reverse or uphold the finding. The decision shall contain findings of fact and a conclusion of law on each issue raised at the hearing.""(e) Any individual aggrieved by the decision of the hearing officer may appeal the decision in accordance with section 4-183. Such individual may also seek a stay of the adverse decision of the hearing officer in accordance with subsection (f) of section 4-183.""(f) Following the issuance of a decision to uphold the finding and absent any stay of that decision issued by the commissioner or the court, the commissioner shall accurately reflect the information concerning the finding in the child abuse and neglect registry maintained pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and shall, in accordance with section 17a-101g, forward to any agency or official the information required to be disclosed pursuant to any provision of the general statutes.""(g) Any individual against whom a finding of abuse or neglect was substantiated prior to May 1, 2000, and who has not previously appealed such finding, may appeal such finding as provided in this section.""(h) Records containing unsubstantiated findings shall remain sealed, except that such records shall be made available to department employees in the proper discharge of their duties and shall be expunged by the commissioner five years from the completion date of the investigation if no further report is made about the individual subject to the investigation, except that if the department receives more than one report on an individual and each report is unsubstantiated, all reports and information pertaining to the individual shall be expunged by the commissioner five years from the completion date of the most recent investigation.""(i) Not later than July 1, 2006, the [commissioner] shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to implement the provisions of this section."" The plaintiff also   challenged the constitutionality of the registry scheme  on the grounds that it is vague, violative of separation of powers and constitutes a bill of attainder. The trial court rejected the plaintiff's constitutional claims, but concluded that it could not determine whether the defendant's decision to place the plaintiff's name on the registry was proper because one factor cited in that  decision was not supported by the record. Accordingly, the trial court remanded the case to the defendant for a determination of whether the plaintiff's name should appear on the registry in the absence of this factor. The plaintiff appeals, and the defendant cross appeals, from that decision. The parties respectively appealed and cross appealed from the trial court's decision to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeals to this court pursuant to General Statutes Â§ 51-199",L,NA

sample_input.xml.xml,JUDICIALCOURTDECISION,F,"Hogan v. Judicial Branch, 64 Fed. Appx. 256, 258 (2d Cir. 2003).In sum, the record supported the hearing officer's finding that the episode with Felix was not an isolated incident. The trial court rejected this finding for two reasons, both of which we reject. First, the court assumed that the sole basis for the hearing officer's finding was the defendant's interview with two detainees, Edward B. and John R.; see footnote 9 of this opinion; and concluded that the testimony  from Bonola simply ""relates the children's 'understanding' that [the plaintiff] had stated his intent of placing one detainee in a room with another."" Our review of the transcript of Bonola's testimony and the report in its entirety supports the hearing officer's conclusion that the plaintiff's threats to these two detainees was not meant to convey the innocuous act of placing detainees in a room together with no intended adverse consequences. There was abundant evidence that detention officers clearly had communicated that a threat to place detainees in  a room together was an implicit threat of, as one shift supervisor described to Bonola, ""what is commonly referred to as a beatdown . . . ."" The plaintiff's conduct with respect to Felix reasonably supports the inference that the plaintiff's threats to place detainees in a room together was intended to convey that message. Indeed, Bonola testified that John's request to transfer to another facility was granted after he expressed fear to detention center officials about the plaintiff's threat, an action that would indicate that such a fear was deemed sufficiently credible.Second, the trial court noted that the arbitrator who had sustained the plaintiff's termination on the basis of the incident with Felix had not found that there were additional incidents. The arbitrator did not find expressly, however, that the plaintiff had not engaged in other acts that had caused detainees to fear for their safety. Rather, he found that the incident with Felix provided a sufficient basis to sustain the plaintiff's termination. The arbitrator did find expressly that the defendant had met all the elements necessary to prove just cause to terminate the plaintiff, one of which relates to whether the degree of discipline was reasonably related to the seriousness of the plaintiff's past offense and the plaintiff's past record. To the extent that the arbitrator opined that the plaintiff is not a ""monster,"" that he ""sincerely cared about the children in his care,"" that frustration had caused the plaintiff to ""behave in a manner that was out of character,"" and that the plaintiff simply has too low a threshold for dealing with a population that has a ""peculiar capacity to frequently push the patience of the average person beyond toleration,"" the hearing officer was not required to adopt the arbitrator's dicta or view of the evidence.
